# Producer-Consumer (Threaded Circular Queue Simulation)

This repository contains the coursework from the ‘Computer Systems’ module of the MSc Computing programme at Imperial College London. It contains a multi-threaded C++ implementation of the Producer-Consumer problem and uses C++20 threads and semaphores to coordinate multiple producers and consumers interacting with a shared circular job queue.
